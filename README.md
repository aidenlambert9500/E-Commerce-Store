# E-Commerce Store

## Description

This project is a simple full-stack e-commerce store implemented with React as a frontend library and Flask as the backend framework. It includes a user login system that requires users to login before accessing our products page as well as saving the cart if the user decides to refresh the page.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone (https://github.com/aidenlambert9500/ENSF381Assignment04.git)`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd E-Commerce Store`
3. Install the frontend dependencies in the 'frontend' folder: `npm install react` and `npm install react-dom`
4. Install the backend dependencies in the 'backend' folder: `pip install Flask` and `pip install flask-cors`

## Usage

To run the project, open two terminals and use `cd backend` for one and `cd frontend` for the other. Then simply run `python app.py` (`python3 app.py` for MacOS) in the backend terminal to run the backend server and `npm start` in the frontend terminal to start the React app.
